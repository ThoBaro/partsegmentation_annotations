# Partsegmentation Annotations

Generated annotations for [Virtual KITTI Dataset v1.3.1](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/computer-vision/proxy-virtual-worlds-vkitti-1/) from my PhD thesis 'Camera-based 3D Vehicle Detection using Semantic Segmentation for Automated Driving' ("Kamerabasierte 3D-Fahrzeugerkennung mittels semantischer Segmentierung f√ºr das automatisierte Fahren").
In my work i separate a vehicle within a semantic segmentation into 29 fine-grained subclasses and use this output as an input to a modell-based pose estimation algorithm. As long as my thesis is not published please refer to the following papers.

[Fine-grained vehicle representations for autonomous driving](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8569930/)

[6DoF vehicle pose estimation using segmentation-based part correspondences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8917012/)

## Format & Usage
The `dataset` folder holds the annotation for the partsegmentation in the original Virtual KITTI format (pngs). Please notice that the folder structure is based on the version 1.3.1.

Please refer to `example.py` for loading the data. Use `requirements.txt` to install required python packages via pip.
